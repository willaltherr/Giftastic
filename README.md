In this assignment, you'll use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. To finish this task, you must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.

1. What the project does:
This project will allow a user to search gif topics from an api that will pull the information into the website.  It will then showcase 10 different gifs based off the button that was clicked or the search query submission.

2. Why the project is useful:
This project is useful because it teaches us how to pull data from an api and specific data from the object to showcase within the website.

3. How users can get started with the project:
Users can get started with this project by searching for a gif or by clicking a current active gif button.  Once the button is clicked or search query is submitted, 10 gifs will appear below.  They will constantly search out for every submitted search and for every button clicked.

4. Where users can get help with your project:
If someone is trying to replicate the project I would encourage them to watch YouTube videos of others who have completed this project.  It is also important to have a basic understanding of html, css, javascript and jquery.  They can also review my respository.

5. Who maintains and contributes to the project:
This project was maintained and contributed by Will Altherr.  In order for me to complete this project I had to use resources within the following: https://www.w3schools.com/js/ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7wL1j1D4KQ
